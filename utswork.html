        <h2 class = "work-subtitle"> UTS App </h2>
        
        <p> The UTS app is a concept app that is designed for the students of the University of Technology, Sydney. The app can be used by students to access their class timetable, view the university map and receive directions to their classrooms, and view university news and upcoming events. </p>

        <h2 class = "work-subtitle"> Pain Points &amp; How to Solve Them </h2>
        
        
        <p> 1.	Timetable, news, events and map are accessed through the web browser on separate websites.  </p>
        
        <p class = "subparagraph"> -	All of this information is integrated into a single app  </p>
        
        <p>  2.	These websites have different log ins and user interfaces.  </p>
        
        <p class = "subparagraph"> -	Students only need to log in once via the app and can access all the available features  </p>
        
        <p> 3.	No enticement to visit UTS news webpage other than to see the news </p>
        
        <p class = "subparagraph"> -	The news feed is available with the other frequently used features such as class timetables and events. As a result, students are more likely to see the university news.  </p>
        
        <p> 4.	Students have a difficult time keeping up with upcoming events as UTS Careers and hundreds of UTS clubs have separate event pages.  </p>
        
        <p class = "subparagraph"> -	Display a single feed that displays all UTS clubs and UTS Careers events. </p>
        
        <p> 5.	Students, especially those who are newly enrolled, have a hard time finding their way around the campus. The official UTS map is a PDF.  </p>
        
        <p class = "subparagraph"> -	An interactive map that provides directions from their current location to the classrooms that they have classes in.  </p>
